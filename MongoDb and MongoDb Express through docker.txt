Description

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly 
and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers – images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. 

Steps:
1.Downloading MongoDB Image using Docker Hub
2.Downloading MongoExpress Image using Docker Hub
3.Creating a network through which MongoDB Server and MongoExpress will be connected
4.Creating a container out of MongoDB Image
5.Creating a container out of MongoExpress Image
6.Accessing MongoDB Server Database on Browser using MongoExpress


**Note: All commands can be found in documentation of container image on docker website.
